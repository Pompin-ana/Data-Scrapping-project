# 🏢 US Largest Companies Data Scraper

Hey there! This project was a fun dive into web scraping. I collected data on the largest companies in the United States by revenue directly from Wikipedia.

## 📈 About the Data

The dataset contains information about the top U.S. companies ranked by revenue, including their name, industry, revenue, employees, and headquarters location. All data was sourced from:

🔗 [List of largest companies in the United States by revenue - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue)

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Wrote a Python script using `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape the data from the Wikipedia table.
- Cleaned and structured the data into a tidy CSV format.
- Saved the output. Now it is ready for analysis.

## 🚀 How to Use the Data

Feel free to download the CSV and use it for your own analysis, visualization, or access my work. The file includes:

- Company name
- Industry
- Revenue (in USD)
- Number of employees
- Headquarters location

## 💡 Why I Built This

I wanted to practice web scraping with real-world data—and what better place to start than a public, well-structured Wikipedia table? It was a great way to improve my data collection and preprocessing skills.

## 👋 A Quick Note

I am early in my data journey and always learning. If you have feedback, ideas, or just want to talk data, feel free to reach out!

Thanks for checking out my project! 🙂
